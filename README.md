## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was a newbie to Xcode and UI design, so it took me a while to comprehend the beauty (and simplicity) of control-drag. 

Update the user-set values to the segmented control display (I spent quite a bit of time finding the method setTitle()). Exploring the methods of various UIelement is a little challenging but also quite fun.

Many tutorials create UIelements through code, which grant more control of the elements but that looks daunting and non-intuitive at first. 

Working with the new Xcode12 while learning on the older-version tutorials is undeniably a source of challenges. But I guess it's just a thing every developer has to go through to keep up with the unceasing evolution of programming.
